Open geminialt.py
you need to generate a gemini api key and create a .env file and add GEMINI_API_KEY = <your_api_key>

The functionality still needs to be connected, individual modules such as start test and end test and submit answer and performance works seperately and not connected yet, 
all the answers are option A right now because of hardcode, will fix it,
timer still needs to be added,
